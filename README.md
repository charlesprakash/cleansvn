A tool to clean SVN directories (.svn)

Imagine you have moved out of SVN to either a different source control system or some other mechanism of managing your files. You will have an annoying .svn file in every folder that you have ever created to the deepest nesting level possible. This program tries to to clean up that folder as you don't have any use for it anymore.
